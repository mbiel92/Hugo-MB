### It was a period of hard work, but also led to many breakthroughs – we have assembled a team of specialists from various fields of cyber security and built the infrastructure necessary for our work.

Our engineers have created laboratories for the purposes of safety testing industrial and building automation.

By performing reverse engineering and fuzzing we filed [9 vulnerability reports](https://seqred.pl/en/bug-bounty/) in the devices of leading manufacturers, with further vulnerabilities currently being reported.

Our team held 3rd place during CC4ES Net GridWars. We shared our knowledge on our blog, during conferences and Technological Breakfasts – which we are inviting you to attend.

Thank you to everyone who has trusted us and appreciated our work!

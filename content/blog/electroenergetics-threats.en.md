Until recently, physical and natural threats were the greatest, if not
the only ones, to menace the proper functioning of energy systems. With
the advent of smart grids and automated devices, power generation has
become a sensitive target for cyber attacks that disrupt the proper
functioning of power generation and distribution systems.

The year 2010 was particularly difficult for Polish power engineers, as
the weather conditions caused icing of power lines, which fell one after
the other. The first serious accident occurred in January this year in
the Świętokrzyskie region when more than 25,000 households were deprived
of electricity supplies. The aura made itself felt at the end of
December of the same year, when - again because of the icing of the
power lines - the failure affected almost the entire northern Poland.
Especially susceptible to breakdowns turned out to be lightning
conductors, which frequently were the first stone of an avalanche of
events.

At that time, real-world threats were more dangerous than cyberattacks.
Only a few months passed from the attack on centrifuges to the
enrichment of uranium at Natanz, Iran, and the world was only awakening
to the awareness of the economic effects of cyber-attacks.

### Network reliability and its dependence on AI

The future for most industries is very similar: maximizing automation
processes and event management, i.e. introducing algorithms and
artificial intelligence to eliminate human errors. The algorithms
created and implemented nowadays are not the only ones able to react to
the problem, but also have knowledge of events that took place in the
past and on this basis they can analyze current trends in behavior and
levels of parameters of individual elements. This allows us to control
processes in a way that prevents the development of dangers. Each new
case is subject to ongoing analysis so that it can feed the algorithm
database and thus improve it.

The same process is currently being carried out in the power industry,
which means it also moves towards the integration of all system elements
into one dynamic and, at the same time, harmonious organism.

### Energetic cyber organism

Sensors and industrial automation components in transformer stations,
critical points in transmission networks and power plants are becoming
increasingly integrated and interdependent. Besides, there is a control
of the reception points (smart meters) and algorithms optimizing the
power flows in the network. Such a process requires skillful
configuration of data network connecting all these elements and
controllers (details in the article: Segmentation of network in the
protection of industrial systems) and extraordinary care for the
protection of the whole network against cyber attacks.

The weakest link of this ecosystem remains man, which is emphasized in
almost all levels of network security and operating elements operating
in it. The most popular are still phishing attacks consisting of sending
out e-mails with dangerous attachments, which openly gives attackers
access to the network, where the infected computer is located or causes
various types of damage to the IT network. However, such an attack is
risky and usually does not give attackers long-term access to the
victim's systems.

Attacks where access to power network management systems is gradual, for
example starting with the company's WiFi network or access by service
technicians who maintain the transformer station or power plant
components, may be more effective.

### Hackers enter through the back door

Each gap in the seemingly uniform security structure may be the
beginning of a series of problems leading to deprivation of electricity
supply or degradation of the quality parameters of the power grid by
shutting down or even permanently damaging the equipment. The longer the
time of unauthorized access to IT networks and power network control
systems, the more time the attackers have to prepare more sophisticated
forms of action and the more surprised the attack may be.

The best example is the Stuxnet malware, created jointly by Israel and
USA, to damage Iranian centrifuges for uranium enrichment. The malware
caused the readings to remain at the correct level when the equipment
was simultaneously driven to the extremes that caused the damage. It is
not difficult to imagine an attack in which the administrator of a power
grid management system receives correct indications of the operation of
the devices, while at the same time there are such deviations in the
network parameters that cause damage to the transformers. If the attack
is properly prepared, some transformer station controllers will not
react, because they will also receive correct indications of current,
voltage, synchronization or temperature, although the reality will be
completely different. It would be a complicated operation, but is it
impossible?

### One step ahead of the attackers

To ensure the security of energy systems, the following activities are
so important:

**The stage of planning, construction, and development of the system:**

-   purchase of appropriate elements of network infrastructure together
    with components of cybersecurity system,
-   control of the hardware and software supply chain to prevent
    intentionally modified elements to gain unauthorized access to the
    infrastructure [(Cybersecurity Bill of
    Materials),](https://seqred.pl/en/cbom-en/)
-   [IT networks segmentation,](https://seqred.pl/segmentacja-sieci-ot/)
-   minimizing the number of services, protocols, and ports to be run.

**Trainings:**

-   development of competence and awareness of threats in your
    organization through regular training for employees in the field of
    cybersecurity (Security Awareness),
-   training in information security, raising awareness of the
    consequences of publishing or transmitting potentially sensitive
    data, the use of which may support the process of cyber-attack
    against the company

**Maintenance of networks and systems:**

-   use of Threat Intelligence service -- current tracking of
    information on new forms of threats, planned attacks and prepared
    malware, regular updates of firewall rules and software upgrades,
-   monitoring, control, and inventory of equipment, software, and tools
    introduced into the network,
-   tests of IT network and its security through regular pentests and
    RedTeam operations,
-   procedures for granting, receiving and modifying access to the
    network for own employees and customers, suppliers and external
    service providers,
-   conducting a policy of changing passwords at all levels of access,
-   Control of public company data (OSINT).

It is constant work, thanks to which cybersecurity systems and
procedures will be at least one step ahead of the attacks.

## Andy is an Android emulator for Windows and Mac.

### During our tests, we have found open local TCP ports which could be exploited to escalate privileges from user to root.

CVEID: **CVE-2019-14326**\
Name of the affected product(s) and version(s): **Andy (all versions up
to 46.11.113)**\
Problem type: **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**

### Summary

All versions of Andy (up to and including 46.11.113, and possibly newer
versions as well) allow telnet and ssh access to root account without
password protection.

### Description

Andy emulator opens ports 22 and 23 inside the emulated Android systems.
These are ssh and telnet ports, giving access to the root shell with no
password protection. While the issue is not exploitable remotely because
the emulated Android device is only visible inside a VMWare network
accessible only to the host operating system and the emulated Android
system itself, it can be used by malicious apps installed inside the
emulated systems to escalate privileges to root without user
interaction.

### Reproduction

echo "\[polecenie_do_wykonania\]" \| busybox telnet localhost 23

### Mitigation

Kill ssh and telnet daemons.

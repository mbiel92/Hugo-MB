MEmu is an Android emulator for Windows. During our tests, we have found
an open TCP port which could be exploited to gain code execution with
root privileges.

**CVEID:** CVE-2019-14514\
**Name of the affected product(s) and version(s):** Microvirt MEmu (all
versions prior to 7.0.2)\
**Problem type:** CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

### Summary

All Microvirt MEmu versions prior to 7.0.2 feature a vulnerable binary
which listens on port 21509. An attacker could gain remote code
execution with root privileges on an emulated Android system by sending
crafted messages containing special characters used as command
delimiters in Unix shells.

### Description

/system/bin/systemd binary (not related to Freedesktop systemd init
system) is run by the root user and listens for commands on port 21509.
If a command starting with installer:uninstall is sent,
attacker-controlled input will be inserted into a shell command template
and passed to /system/bin/sh without verification or escaping. This
means that a remote attacker could insert special characters like ;, &&
or \|\| to send his own shell commands which will be executed on the
emulated system with root privileges.

### Reproduction

echo "installer:uninstall;\[polecenie_do_wykonania\]" \| nc
\[ip_emulatora\] 21509

The emulator should execute the command and then reboot.

### Remedy

Update MEmu to version 7.0.2 or later.

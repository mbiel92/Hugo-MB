In order to ensure the cyber security of operations for staff working remotely it is vital to implement a number of appropriate procedures and technical measures. Adequate preparation of devices and systems used, as well as maintaining appropriate safety practices can vastly decrease the risk of cyber attacks and therefore prevent the company from suffering losses.

### How to safely access company applications and resources while working remotely?

*   Use a VPN when accessing company resources
*   Encrypt files and emails before sending them.
*   Use company-issued devices equipped with adequate safeguards.
*   Avoid accessing company data on personal computers and mobile devices.

### Use the Internet Safely and Securely\*

When working remotely, you need to ensure adequate protection for your internet-connected devices from viruses and malware.

### Keep Your Antivirus Program Up To Date

Make sure your internet security software is to date and to stay current with your software and operating system’s updates to ensure protection against new and emerging threats.

### Back Up Your Data

Regularly create backup copies of documents and files and make sure you’re storing them in a secure location. This will help in lost data recovery (e.g. in case of [a ransomware attack](https://seqred.pl/en/ransomware/)).

### Be aware of cybercrime

Through sending fake emails and redirecting to counterfeit websites, hackers often utilise our emotions to obtain sensitive data. In order to prevent this, don’t open suspicious emails, don’t give away confidential information, don’t click on suspicious links and don’t open attachments.

### Lock your computer

When you leave your computer somewhere, make sure to lock it first in order to prevent unauthorised persons from gaining access to your computer and data stored on it.

### Make sure your internet connection is not overloaded

Make sure you do not download data or update systems while on a conference call. This will prevent any issues with video or audio from appearing.

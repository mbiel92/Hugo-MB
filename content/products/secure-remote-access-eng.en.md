## Differentiating Honeywell Secure Remote Access{ .article-section }

### **Unique Honeywell Technology**

*   No inbound firewall rules, all connections initiated from inside the high trust network over a single outbound port (aka., reverse tunnel). No direct attack surface!
*   Multifactor authentication to Security Center, separate from local per-site authorization.
*   Customer-controlled human authorization per session. Allowing site autonomy in addition to centralized user management
*   Authorization is time-limited per-session, per-user, per-protocol.
*   Just-in-time point-to-point channel is established within reverse-tunnel, after authorization. By default, no remote access channel from Security Center to Site until needed.
*   Remote user or remote computer is never part of trusted network. Cannot escape the point-to-point channel established across trusted and untrusted networks
*   Password vault holds the actual password, it is never revealed to the remote user. Avoids the complexity of sharing passwords or changing them after each use or termination of access.
*   Real-time supervision (i.e., screen sharing), recording, playback, and session termination. Supports both forensic incident investigation and training.
*   Local authority to terminate sessions for unrecognized, suspicious behavior, or plant operational situation changes (e.g., plant upset, shutdown, emergency).
*   Full audit trail of requests, authorizations, protocols, sessions, users, etc.
*   Remote VSE Service Node must be pre-registered with Security Center to function (no rogue nodes)
*   ISA-Secure Certified Development Organization (HPS Secure Development Process)
*   ISO/IEC 27001 Certified security management system for Managed Security Service Center.
*   Numerous customer, OEM partner, 3rd-party, and internal penetration tests and security reviews of Managed Security Service Centers and software code.

_**Trusted by Honeywell, OEM Partners, and Customers for Secure Remote Support of over 4,000 Industrial Installations**_

### **Traditional User VPN**

*   Remote computer is member of Company network
*   Once connected, unrestricted access to trusted networks
*   Always-on 24/7
*   Always authorized
*   Logging of session connection & termination only
*   Network access pre-configured in firewall rules
*   Can be accidentally left connected

### **Both VPN And Honeywell**

*   Multifactor Authentication (Internet edge)
*   TLS 1.2 encryption. FIPS 140-2 compliant.
*   Tunneled across Internet
*   PKI Certificates

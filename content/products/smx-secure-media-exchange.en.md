## PROTECT AGAINST-BORNE USB THREATS{ class="section-header my-4" }

Since discovery of the Stuxnet computer virus, industrial organizations have struggled with finding secure ways to use and monitor removable media. Unfortunately, many cybersecurity tools and strategies have failed to adapt to operational demands. Throughout industries such as refining, pulp & paper, oil & gas, mining & minerals, pharmaceuticals, power generation, buildings, manufacturing and aerospace removable media are critical to maintaining the availability and security of plant processes. USBs are one of the top threat vectors in the industrial space, yet they remain a principal method for updating and maintaining critical system configurations.

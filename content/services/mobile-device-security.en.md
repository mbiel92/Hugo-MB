## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

With the development of mobile technologies, the security of smartphones has become as important as the security of servers or personal computers. Modern phones are devices used not only for telephone communication, but also for navigation, Internet browsing, or electronic payments. Their widespread use, also for business purposes, results in the need to verify their security against unauthorised access.

As part of the service, we conduct an analysis of network traffic looking for the presence of malware (e.g. communication with a C&C server, sending private data without the userâ€™s knowledge). We analyse applications on the device for the presence of malware or other indicators of compromise left after malicious activities. If necessary, we can reverse engineer suspicious applications.

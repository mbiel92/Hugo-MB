## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

Cyber-attacks are a real threat to business. Cybersecurity is not only about securing a company’s IT equipment or introducing, for example, a policy of hard-to-guess passwords. Currently, most attacks on IT / OT infrastructure are a combination of three areas: violation of the physical security of the company, social engineering activities carried out on employees, and the use of technology to penetrate the ICT network.

Red Team operations are controlled hacker attacks carried out in the way they actually occur. The Red Team appears on the company’s premises, interacts with employees, finds IT infrastructure weaknesses and the company’s weakest security points. As a result, it is able to detect critical vulnerabilities in the security system.

Depending on the company’s needs and specifics, we offer: 


* full Red Team operation,
* penetration tests of IT solution,
* cybersecurity training for employees and management staff

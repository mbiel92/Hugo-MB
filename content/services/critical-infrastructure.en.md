## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

The loss of control over infrastructure assets can lead to severe consequences. The sources of threats are not only natural disasters but also cyber attacks by terrorist groups and state organisations. The introduction of TCP/IP protocols and the penetration of IT and OT networks, even in critical infrastructure systems pose a threat to security and the availability of services. Adversaries may use known or unknown vulnerabilities to take control of protection devices, IEDs, PLCs, RTUs, and SCADA systems.

## How can we help?{ class="section-header my-4" }

{{< container type="fluid" class="text-white bg-sq-3" >}}
{{< container class="py-4" >}}

We will assess the security of critical infrastructure and identify threatened areas in the following layers: SCADA systems, PLCs, RTUs, IEDs, field protection devices, network segmentation and separation. We will conduct a controlled attack on critical infrastructure assets following an approved scope and an agreed scenario. This will allow to assess the current level of security and identify areas under threat, as well as the potential consequences of a cyberattack. We will help develop proper procedures and incident response methods. In particular, we offer:

__Cybersecurity Audit:__ security assessment of critical infrastructure components, key organizational layer processes to identify threats, and implement corrective actions. A special case of such an audit is the examination of compliance with the polish implementation of NIS Directive (Ustawa o Krajowym Systemie Cyberbezpiecze≈Ñstwa).

Cybersecurity audit may include __penetration tests__ of components such as: SCADA system, operator and engineering stations, devices providing remote access, control devices: PLC, IED, RTU using network protocols, among others IEC60870-5: 104, IEC 61850, DNP3 and Modbus TCP / IP.

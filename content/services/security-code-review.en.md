## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

The degree of software complexity is increasing year by year, and programming errors remain a common root cause of vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals. In some cases, programmers may deliberately create pieces of code to help them gain control over a program or to stop it. Although penetration tests are becoming more and more popular, there are vulnerabilities that can be difficult or even impossible to find without a comprehensive analysis of both the source code and the application itself.

We carry out comprehensive security code reviews. We use modern static and dynamic analysis methods to detect potential problems with the security of server software, web applications, and embedded systems firmware.

Thanks to the use of both automatic and manual methods of finding vulnerabilities, we discover programming and configuration errors that can lead to taking control of the system, leakage of private data and disruptions in operation. We can also identify code intentionally placed to reduce the security of the system (so-called backdoors).

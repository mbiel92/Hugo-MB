## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

The focus on effective delivery of business services sets a rapid pace for modern companies’ operations. The multitude and variety of ICT systems as well as the lack of appropriate procedures for inventory and configuration management can lead to a failure to update systems, uncontrolled connections being established between unknown devices and the infrastructure or the occurrence of vulnerabilities in systems. These types of violations could lead to an increased exposure to difficult to detect cyberattacks, the aftermath of which may affect the company’s image and budget.

As part of penetration tests, we will identify vulnerabilities in the inspected infrastructure or system and suggest specific corrective measures to mitigate the identified issues. We take an individual approach to each test, which allows us to conduct an analysis taking into account possible vectors of attack. The finalised report on identified vulnerabilities is supplemented with a scoring index developed on the basis of well-established methodologies (e.g. CVSS 3.0).

## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

The way software is created is progressively becoming more automated and integrated. Consequently, a secure approach to both software creation and development has never been so important. Numerous security incidents take place because software developers are unaware of risks related to implementing new, untested functionalities and technologies.

In the process of developing a new product, it is vital to ensure its quality and security throughout the development cycle: from the initial design stage, through creation and testing, to a final audit completed with an incident response plan. The correct implementation of security requirements can largely aid the protection against the potential cyberattacks, and with that save the company and its customers from suffering any financial losses.

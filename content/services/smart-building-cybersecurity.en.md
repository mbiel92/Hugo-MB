## Challenges{ class="section-header my-4" }

More and more frequently, Smart Buildings become the target of cyberattacks. The number of vendors and solutions, combined with the growing range of IoT (Internet of Things) devices added to the Smart Building systems and allowing those devices to access the Internet, create an ever-growing threat to the security of all areas of business operations. Both for the owners and the tenants of the buildings. Nowadays, we need to prioritize keeping the operations safe from sensitive data loss and interference to the functioning of the building.

Two facts are obvious: software is eating the world and today every company is a software company. How this relates to the real-estate market? Who should care or maybe it’s everyone’s concern? About cybersecurity challenges in the real-estate market and threats and real-life attack cases Krzysztof Swaczyński – Founder and Board Member at SEQRED S.A. is speaking

We will evaluate the architecture of the Smart Building’s systems and its components in the context of cybersecurity. We will conduct a controlled attack on the building, the scope of the attack will be arranged with you beforehand, so will be the scenario of the attack. This will allow us to assess the current level of security and to identify the areas which are under threat. The test will also show the potential consequences of a cyberattack. We will help you develop proper procedures and repair methods to implement in case of a security incident.

__Penetration test:__ verifies the effectiveness of the security mechanism implemented in the Smart Building solutions. The test’s scope can cover such components as for example:
* Smart Building systems’ servers,
* mobile applications used to manage the system,
* sensors / devices equipped with network protocols.
